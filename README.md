# ![](/DASISH/qddt-client/wiki/images/qddt.png)DASISH QDDT - Questionnaire Design and Documentation Tool
=========================================================

The key aim of the DASISH QDDT is to provide a system for developing and documenting the entire questionnaire development of cross-national survey programmes, from the first concepts and questions to the final questionnaire. This will improve not only the quality and transparency, but also the efficiency, of the questionnaire design process.
The requirements for the QDDT are defined as follows:

 * The system can handle differing amounts of information at different times during the design process.
 * Internal users can use the tool to document the question design process, whilst external users can use it to understand how each item and concept was developed
 * Different levels of access rights can be awarded to different users 
 * Once the design for a module in a round has been completed, the information can be made available for download and be permanently stored in the database for future use and reference.  
 * Compatibility with the DDI-Lifecycle is achieved, to allow for interoperability with other tools and systems.
 * A system architecture that enables easy exchange of metadata in DDI format to other task 3.2 tools has been built.
 * This should comprehend file-based import and export, as well as communication by web-services.
 * The QDDT has been tested for compliance with the identified use cases by members of WP3.2 as well as by selected external persons.


### Software development status

The QDDT is currently under development. A prototype with limited functionality is available.
